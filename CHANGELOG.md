Changelog

v0.1 ‚Äì Initial Data Loading
	‚Ä¢	Exported GA4 sample dataset from BigQuery into Parquet in GCS.
	‚Ä¢	Set up Snowflake STORAGE INTEGRATION and STAGE to pull Parquet files into RAW.EVENTS_FLAT.
	‚Ä¢	Learned the hard way that EXPORT DATA can‚Äôt touch GA4 meta tables, so had to flatten and export per date.
	‚Ä¢	Hit timestamp issues (event_timestamp looked like garbage) ‚Üí fixed with TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(event_timestamp/1e6).

‚∏ª

v0.2 ‚Äì First Staging Layer
	‚Ä¢	Built stg_ga4_events.sql to standardise GA4 columns (event_ts, source, medium, price, qty, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Added dedup with row_number(), but at first my key was too coarse (didn‚Äôt include price/qty).
	‚Ä¢	Discovered MART totals didn‚Äôt line up with raw.
	‚Ä¢	Realised GA4 raw exports do include duplicates, which inflate revenue.

‚∏ª

v0.3 ‚Äì Dedup Refinement
	‚Ä¢	Refined row_key to use (event_dt, user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id, item_id, item_name, price, quantity).
	‚Ä¢	Reconciled against a strict dedup baseline (RAW_REV_DEDUP).
	‚Ä¢	Confirmed duplicate inflation was the big reason for revenue gaps.
	‚Ä¢	Learned that aligning MART with strict dedup gives me stable, trustworthy KPIs.

‚∏ª

v0.4 ‚Äì Clean Purchase Lines
	‚Ä¢	Found ~25 ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù rows with null price/qty.
	‚Ä¢	Decided to keep them visible in stg_ga4_events but filter them out in a new view: stg_ga4_purchase_lines.
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted facts to consume from stg_ga4_purchase_lines only.
	‚Ä¢	Fixed my failing singular test (no more trailing semicolon mistakes üòÖ).
	‚Ä¢	Tests now pass cleanly.

‚∏ª

v0.5 ‚Äì Fact Tables and KPIs
	‚Ä¢	Built fct_purchases_daily ‚Üí daily revenue, orders (distinct order_key), AOV.
	‚Ä¢	Built fct_attribution_daily ‚Üí revenue/orders by source, medium, campaign.
	‚Ä¢	Reconciliation test added: MART vs strict dedup.
	‚Ä¢	Now MART aligns with RAW_DEDUP (tiny diffs only).
	‚Ä¢	Locked dedup logic with dbt tests (unique row_key, recomputation test).
	‚Ä¢	Core KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Revenue by Channel) are now in place.

‚∏ª

Current Status
	‚Ä¢	End-to-end pipeline runs from GA4 ‚Üí GCS ‚Üí Snowflake ‚Üí dbt ‚Üí clean marts.
	‚Ä¢	Dedup logic solid.
	‚Ä¢	Tests ensure no regressions.
	‚Ä¢	Fact models produce stable metrics ready for dashboards.

‚∏ª

Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	Document dedup contract clearly in README.
	‚Ä¢	Add metrics YAML for semantic KPIs.
	‚Ä¢	Build trend signals (WoW deltas, anomalies, z-scores).
	‚Ä¢	Create AI insights table for dashboards.
	‚Ä¢	Hook up Power BI / Tableau with KPI cards + Insights panel.
