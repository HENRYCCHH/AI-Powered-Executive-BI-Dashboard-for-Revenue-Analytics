Changelog

v0.1 ‚Äì Initial Data Loading
	‚Ä¢	Exported GA4 sample dataset from BigQuery into Parquet in GCS.
	‚Ä¢	Set up Snowflake STORAGE INTEGRATION and STAGE to pull Parquet files into RAW.EVENTS_FLAT.
	‚Ä¢	Learned the hard way that EXPORT DATA can‚Äôt touch GA4 meta tables, so had to flatten and export per date.
	‚Ä¢	Hit timestamp issues (event_timestamp looked like garbage) ‚Üí fixed with TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(event_timestamp/1e6).

‚∏ª

v0.2 ‚Äì First Staging Layer
	‚Ä¢	Built stg_ga4_events.sql to standardise GA4 columns (event_ts, source, medium, price, qty, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Added dedup with row_number(), but at first my key was too coarse (didn‚Äôt include price/qty).
	‚Ä¢	Discovered MART totals didn‚Äôt line up with raw.
	‚Ä¢	Realised GA4 raw exports do include duplicates, which inflate revenue.

‚∏ª

v0.3 ‚Äì Dedup Refinement
	‚Ä¢	Refined row_key to use (event_dt, user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id, item_id, item_name, price, quantity).
	‚Ä¢	Reconciled against a strict dedup baseline (RAW_REV_DEDUP).
	‚Ä¢	Confirmed duplicate inflation was the big reason for revenue gaps.
	‚Ä¢	Learned that aligning MART with strict dedup gives me stable, trustworthy KPIs.

‚∏ª

v0.4 ‚Äì Clean Purchase Lines
	‚Ä¢	Found ~25 ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù rows with null price/qty.
	‚Ä¢	Decided to keep them visible in stg_ga4_events but filter them out in a new view: stg_ga4_purchase_lines.
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted facts to consume from stg_ga4_purchase_lines only.
	‚Ä¢	Fixed my failing singular test (no more trailing semicolon mistakes üòÖ).
	‚Ä¢	Tests now pass cleanly.

‚∏ª

v0.5 ‚Äì Fact Tables and KPIs
	‚Ä¢	Built fct_purchases_daily ‚Üí daily revenue, orders (distinct order_key), AOV.
	‚Ä¢	Built fct_attribution_daily ‚Üí revenue/orders by source, medium, campaign.
	‚Ä¢	Reconciliation test added: MART vs strict dedup.
	‚Ä¢	Now MART aligns with RAW_DEDUP (tiny diffs only).
	‚Ä¢	Locked dedup logic with dbt tests (unique row_key, recomputation test).
	‚Ä¢	Core KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Revenue by Channel) are now in place.

‚∏ª

v0.6 ‚Äì Date Spine & Trend Signals
‚Ä¢ Created dense dim_date and a zero-filled purchase view to include empty days.
‚Ä¢ Added WoW deltas, 7-day moving averages, z-score anomaly flags.
‚Ä¢ Fixed partial date coverage (Nov no-sales span) so trends compute correctly.

‚∏ª

v0.7 ‚Äì Channel Trends & Top Movers
‚Ä¢ Built v_channel_daily, v_channel_trends, and a ‚ÄúTop Movers‚Äù query with an improved impact score (size + rate).
‚Ä¢ Power BI star schema: DIM_DATE + DIM_CHANNEL to Facts and Views (composite key on Source/Medium/Campaign).
‚Ä¢ DAX patterns for: anchor last date, rolling windows (Day/Week/Month/Total), dynamic labels, YoY/QoQ/MoM/WoW.

‚∏ª

v0.8 ‚Äì AI Insights (LLM) ‚Äì Storage & Serving
‚Ä¢ Created GA4_DEMO.DEV_MART.AI_INSIGHTS table (headline, bullets, actions, JSON inputs, model metadata).
‚Ä¢ Wrote ai_insight_writer.py (daily) and ai_insight_backfill.py (one-time historical) using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
‚Ä¢ Enforced JSON schema in prompts; compact display_text renderer (headline + 2 bullets + ‚ÄúNext steps‚Äù).
‚Ä¢ Rate-limit + retry logic; safe defaults when revenue/orders are zero (no token spend).

‚∏ª

v0.9 ‚Äì Security, Roles & Connectivity
‚Ä¢ Provisioned AI_APP_ROLE (runtime) and BI_VIEWER_ROLE (read-only); created AI_WRITER and POWERBI_SVC users.
‚Ä¢ Granted USAGE on DB/Schema/Warehouse; SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on AI_INSIGHTS.
‚Ä¢ Power BI connection via SSO + ODBC DSN; MFA-friendly setup validated.

‚∏ª

v1.0 ‚Äì Executive Dashboard (Power BI)
‚Ä¢ KPI cards + dynamic titles; date anchor slicer + compare-mode slicer (Day/Week/Month/Total).
‚Ä¢ Line trends with anchor marker; Top Movers table ranked by impact (robust RANKX over SUMMARIZE with TREATAS).
‚Ä¢ AI Insight card bound to AI_INSIGHTS.display_text and filtered by date/type for instant narrative.
‚Ä¢ Visual polish: readable labels, compact legends, clean titles, short source labels (‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù for redacted).

‚∏ª

v1.1 ‚Äì Backfill & Data Quality Enhancements
‚Ä¢ Backfilled 2020-11-01 ‚Üí 2021-01-31 with four insights per day (Total/Month/Week/Day).
‚Ä¢ Skipped LLM calls for 2020-11 (no purchases) using default insights.
‚Ä¢ Patched individual holes (e.g., missing 2020-12-01 Total insight).
‚Ä¢ Eliminated QUALIFY misuse in Python queries; swapped to supported filters when needed.

‚∏ª

v1.2 ‚Äì DevEx, Docs & Sharing
‚Ä¢ Added .env.example, Readme, repo structure, and runbook notes.
‚Ä¢ GIF demo + LinkedIn copy; clarified free-tier LLM limits and model choices.
‚Ä¢ Compact text utility (ai_display_compact.py) merged into writer/backfill for consistent output.
